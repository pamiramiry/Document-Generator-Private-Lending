ðŸ“„ Loan Agreement Template Generator


This Node.js project dynamically generates a loan agreement using LiquidJS templating.

ðŸ”§ What It Does
Fills in a loan agreement template with custom data like lender, borrower, loan amount, interest rate, and term length.

Automatically calculates yearly interest and displays it in a table.

Outputs the final result as an HTML file (output.html).

ðŸ’¡ How It Works
You define the loan details in the data object (e.g., term, interest rate).

The template uses Liquid syntax (e.g., {{amount}}, {% for %}) to dynamically insert and loop through values.

The rendered result is written to output.html for viewing or conversion to PDF.

ðŸ›  Tech Used
Node.js

LiquidJS (templating engine)

fs for file writing
